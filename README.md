Developed a logistic regression model to assess correlations between nine independent variables and breast tumor 
classification (benign or malignant)
 The model utilized odds ratios and confidence intervals to identify significant predictors of breast cancer. It's important to note 
that model performance relies on the accuracy of radiologists in detecting mammogram findings.
